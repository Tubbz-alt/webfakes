The webfakes package comes with two apps that
allow to imitate the simplified OAuth2.0 flow described in
[Aaron Parecki's tutorial](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/).
One app (`oauth2_resource_app()`) is the API server (resource/authorization),
the other plays the role of a third-party app.
They are useful when testing or demonstrating code handling OAuth2.0
authorization, token caching, etc. in a package:
The apps can be used in your tests directly,
or you could adapt one of them / both of them to better mimick a particular
OAuth2.0 flow.
