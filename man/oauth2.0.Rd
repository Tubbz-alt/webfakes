\arguments{
\item{access_duration}{After how many seconds should access tokens expire.}

\item{refresh_duration}{After how many seconds should refresh tokens expire
(ignored if \code{refresh} is \code{FALSE}).}

\item{refresh}{Should a refresh token be returned (logical).}

\item{seed}{Random seed used when creating tokens.}

\item{stream}{R connection to log to. \code{"stdout"} means the standard
output, \code{"stderr"} is the standard error. You can also supply a
connection object, but then you need to be sure that it will be
valid when the app is actually running.}

\description{
The webfakes package comes with two app that allow to imitate the
simplified OAuth2.0 flow described in \href{https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/}{Aaron Pareckiâ€™s tutorial}. One app
(\code{oauth2_resource_app()}) is the API server (resource/authorization),
the other plays the role of a third-party app. They are useful when
testing or demonstrating code handling OAuth2.0 authorization, token
caching, etc. in a package: The apps can be used in your tests directly,
or you could adapt one of them / both of them to better mimick a
particular OAuth2.0 flow.
