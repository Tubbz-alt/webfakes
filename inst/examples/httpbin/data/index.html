    Hi, this is a placeholder for the documentation of
    `presser::httpbin_app()`, the R implementation of the excellent
    <a href="https://httpbin.org">https://httpbin.org</a> service.

    For now please see the source code for the API, e.g. at
    <a href= "https://github.com/r-lib/presser/blob/master/R/httpbin.R">https://github.com/r-lib/presser/blob/master/R/httpbin.R</a>
