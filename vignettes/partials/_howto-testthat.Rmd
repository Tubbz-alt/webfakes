You can use testthat's setup and teardown files.
You start the app in a setup file and stop it in a teardown file.
See `?testthat::source_file`.
Your `tests/testthat/setup-http.R` may look like this:

```{r}
http <- presser::new_app_process(presser::httpbin_app())
```

Your `tests/testthat/teardown-http.R` will be

```{r, eval = FALSE}
http$stop()
```

In the test cases you can query the `http` app process to get the URLs you need to connect to:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(testthat)
```

```{r}
test_that("fails on 404", {
  url <- http$url("/status/404")
  response <- httr::GET(url)
  expect_error(
    httr::stop_for_status(response),
    class = "http_404"
  )
})
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
http$stop()
```

When writing your tests interactively, you may create a `http` app process in the global environment, for convenience.
You can `source()` your `setup-http.R` file for this.
